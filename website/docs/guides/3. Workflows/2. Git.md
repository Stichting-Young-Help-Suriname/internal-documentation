This project uses a hybrid Git workflow that combines principles of **trunk-based development** with elements of **GitFlow**. This allows for flexibility in fast-paced feature development while maintaining code quality and stability across environments.
## Branch Workflow
### 🧱 Branch Overview
We maintain **three permanent branches** in the repository:

| Branch    | Purpose            | Environment           | Stability       |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------- |
| `main`    | Production release | Public build          | ✅ Stable        |
| `staging` | Pre-release / QA   | Internal testers & PM | 🟡 In review    |
| `dev`     | Active development | Developers only       | 🔴 Experimental |

All new features start from the `staging` branch.
### 🌱 Feature Development Flow
#### Steps:

1. **Checkout from staging:**
```
git checkout staging 
git pull
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```
	
2. **Work on your feature**, then commit and push regularly.
    
3. **When done**, merge into `dev`:
```
git checkout dev
git pull
git merge feat/your-feature-name
```
4. **Create a Pull Request** into `staging`. A lead developer will:
    
    - Review your code
        
    - Test the feature
        
    - Merge into `staging` once it passes QA
### 🛠️ Hotfix Flow

For bugs found in production (`main`):

1. Checkout a new hotfix branch from `staging`:
```
git checkout staging 
git pull 
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-description
```
1. Fix the bug, then merge into `staging`:
```
git checkout staging 
git merge hotfix/fix-description
```
    
2. After approval, merge `staging` into `main` for release:
```
git checkout main 
git merge staging 
git tag v1.2.1 
git push --tags
```

> ❗ Always base hotfixes off `staging`, **not main**, to keep history clean and consistent.
### 🚀 Release Flow

When the `staging` branch has a collection of approved features:

1. Lead developer merges `staging` into `main`:
```
git checkout main 
git pull 
git merge staging
```
2. A **new release version** is tagged following **SemVer** (e.g. `v1.2.0`):
```
git tag v1.2.0 
git push --tags
```
3. The application is built and deployed.
    
4. **Post-deploy**, staging is **reset and synced** with main:
    
    - Existing staging data is wiped
        
    - Fresh data from main is imported
### 💡Branch Naming Conventions

Use the following prefixes to make branches easy to track:

| Prefix      | Usage                       | Example                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `feat/`     | New features                | `feat/triangle-mini-game`      |
| `hotfix/`   | Urgent production bug fixes | `hotfix/fraction-division-bug` |
| `bugfix/`   | General bug fixes           | `bugfix/nav-hover-state`       |
| `docs/`     | Documentation changes       | `docs/git-workflow`            |
| `refactor/` | Code structure improvements | `refactor/component-layout`    |
### 📦 Environments at a Glance

| Branch    | Environment | Build Purpose             | Data Policy                 |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `main`    | Production  | Public release            | Real user data              |
| `staging` | QA/Internal | Beta build for PM/testers | Wiped + synced from `main`  |
| `dev`     | Developer   | Experimental              | Mock/generated data allowed |

### ✅ Branch Workflow Summary

- **Developers**: Work in feature branches → merge to `dev` → submit PR to `staging`
- **Leads**: Review → test → merge to `staging` → merge collections into `main`
- **QA**: Happens on `staging`
- **Public**: Sees only `main`
- **SemVer** is used for versioning (`major.minor.patch`)
## Commit Guidelines
### 📝 Commit Conventions

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification to keep our Git history clean, readable, and automatable.
Each commit message should follow this format:
```
<type>(optional scope): <short summary>  
[optional body]  
[optional footer(s)]
```

### ✅ Examples
```
feat(mini-game): add triangle game mechanics 
fix(auth): prevent crash when token expires 
refactor(average): simplify calculation logic 
docs(readme): add setup instructions 
chore: update dependencies 
test(fractions): add unit tests for reduceFraction()`
```
### 🎯 Commit Types

| Type       | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `refactor` | Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature             |
| `perf`     | A code change that improves performance                           |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                          |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks like builds, dependency updates, etc            |

### 🔒 Rules & Tips

- Use **present tense**: _“add”, not “added” or “adds”_
    
- Start your message with a lowercase letter (unless it’s a proper noun)
    
- Keep the summary under 72 characters
    
- Add a body if you need to explain **why** the change was made
    
- You can reference issues or tasks in the footer:
```
Fixes #42
