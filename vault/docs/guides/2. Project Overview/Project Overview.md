**Project Name**: YHS Math Game 2.0

**Introduction:** 
In 2025, Foundation Young Help Suriname released the first version of its Math Game in collaboration with IDB Lab and the Ministry of Education as part of its HYPE (Helping Youth Progress in Education) program. This game was aimed as a way for students in grade 10 (2e MULO) to be able to practice and test their math skills in the areas of triangles, averages and fractions using their mobile devices. The game was released in conjunction with a YouTube channel that has videos about the different topics addressed in the game.

For a second iteration of this game, the development team will consist of motivated students and/or young professionals who are still building their real-world skills. This project will not only deliver an improved learning tool, but it will also showcase that there is talent and experience available amongst our own team to be able to develop more of these types of projects in the future.

**Target Platform:** Mobile devices (Android + iOS)
