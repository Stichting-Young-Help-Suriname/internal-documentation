 Inside of Trello, there will be 3 boards visible: Master Planning, Designer Board and Application Board. 

Every board contains the following lists: 
- Backlog
- Upcoming
- Doing
- Review
- Complete

**Backlog** contains all features/tasks that do not have a planned sprint or are not applicable for the current sprint.

When tasks are assigned to you that need to be completed in the current sprint, those tasks will be put into **Upcoming** by a lead.

As soon as you start working on this task, you drag this task into the **Doing** list.

If you are done with a task, you drag this to **Review** to get it reviewed. The leads do code and design reviews and when the code/visuals check out, the PM tests the feature to make sure it validates the requirements for that specific feature.

Whenever a task isn't approved by a lead, it will be put back into **Upcoming** with feedback attached in the form of a comment on the card.

After approval by leads and the project manager, will the task be dragged into **Complete**
